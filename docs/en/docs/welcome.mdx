# Make it Easy to Develop Cross-Browser Extensions

## What is Extension.js?

Extension.js is a command-line tool that simplifies the development of cross-browser extensions. It provides built-in support for [TypeScript](/docs/guides/development/modern-javascript/typescript), [WebAssembly](/docs/guides/development/webassembly), and [next-generation JavaScript](/docs/guides/development/modern-javascript/overview).

With Extension.js, you work directly with native browser extension APIs — there’s no abstraction layer, so you have full control over the functionality of your extensions. You use the native browser extension APIs to extend the functionality of web browsers, and Extension.js to develop them using with a modern development stack.

If you're new to browser extension development, Extension.js is a great place to start. It provides a simple and intuitive way to create, develop, and deploy browser extensions. If you're already familiar with browser extension development, Extension.js can help you streamline your workflow and make your development process more efficient.

## Create a New Extension

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "62.5%",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/58e21900d693417db1e0e59c0a96c4b3?sid=80cf1003-7ed1-4f9d-a3fb-01c7876983ad"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

The `extension` package has a default `create` command that generates the foundation of your next extension project (as shown in the demo above). You can also use the `--template` flag to specify a template.

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest create <your-extension-name>",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest create <your-extension-name>",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension <your-extension-name>",
  }}
/>

For a list of all supported templates, check out the [Templates](/docs/getting-started/templates) page.

## Use with an Existing Extension

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "62.5%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/c7ae4fc7cdfc47c39334c7efe3175dd9?sid=035792a7-aec9-4f1a-852b-47ca7166a539"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

If you already have an extension and are using a package manager, you can install the `extension` package and manually create the scripts needed to run your extension. Refer to the demo above or follow these steps:

### Step 1 - Install Extension.js as a `devDependency`

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npm install extension@latest --save-dev",
    pnpm: "pnpm add extension@latest --save-dev",
    yarn: "yarn add extension@latest --dev",
  }}
/>

### Step 2 - Link your npm scripts to the `extension` commands

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "extension@latest build",
    "dev": "extension@latest dev",
    "start": "extension start"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "extension": "latest"
  }
}
```

That's it! You're all set.

- Run `npm run dev` to develop your extension.
- Run `npm run start` to preview your extension in production mode.
- Run `npm run build` to bundle your extension for production.
