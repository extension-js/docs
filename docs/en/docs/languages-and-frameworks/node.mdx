# Node APIs in Browser Extensions

Extension.js enables the use of Node.js APIs in browser extension development,
but requires some additional configuration due to the differences between Node.js and browser environments.
By adding `node-polyfill-webpack-plugin` to your `extension.config.js` file,
you can polyfill Node.js core modules, making them usable in your extension's JavaScript files.

## Setting Up Node Polyfills

To use Node.js APIs like `fs`, `path`, or `crypto` in a browser extension,
you must configure webpack to include polyfills for the missing Node.js modules.
This is done by adding the **`node-polyfill-webpack-plugin`** in your `extension.config.js` file.

## Example: `extension.config.js`

```js
const NodePolyfillPlugin = require("node-polyfill-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  config: (config) => {
    config.plugins.push(new NodePolyfillPlugin());
    return config;
  },
};
```

In this configuration file, we use NodePolyfillPlugin to inject polyfills for Node.js APIs. This allows Node.js modules to be imported and used directly in your browser extension.

## Node APIs in Action

Once the polyfills are set up, you can use Node.js APIs as you normally would in a Node.js environment. For example, you could use the path and fs modules to manage file paths or manipulate files:

```js
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");

const filePath = path.join(__dirname, "example.txt");
fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("File contents:", data);
});
```

In this example, the fs module reads a file in the extension's directory. This would not be possible without polyfilling Node.js modules, as the browser environment does not natively support them.

## Usage with Existing Extensions

To add Node.js support to an existing extension, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the Required Plugin

Add the node-polyfill-webpack-plugin to your project:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npm install --save-dev node-polyfill-webpack-plugin",
    pnpm: "pnpm install --save-dev node-polyfill-webpack-plugin",
    yarn: "yarn add --dev node-polyfill-webpack-plugin",
  }}
/>

### 2. Modify extension.config.js

Ensure your extension.config.js file includes the polyfill plugin, as shown in the example above. This will allow you to use Node.js APIs in your extension.

## Caveats

Not all Node.js APIs are suitable for use in a browser context, as the browser environment has inherent limitations compared to Node.js. For example, you cannot access the file system on the user’s machine beyond the sandboxed areas allowed by the extension APIs.
