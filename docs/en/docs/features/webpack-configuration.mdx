The `extension.config.js` file enables developers to adjust the behavior of Extension.js.
This configuration file provides flexibility by enabling browser-specific configurations,
command customization, and support for the massive ecosystem of webpack loaders and plugins.

## How Does It Work?

Adding a `extension.config.js` file at the same level as your `manifest.json` file will
extend the capabilities of Extension.js. The config file includes the following keys:

| Key      | Description                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config` | Modifies the webpack configuration for added flexibility. |

### Webpack Configuration

The `config` key allows you to modify the default webpack configuration. This gives you
the power to add additional loaders or plugins:

```js
config: (config) => {
  config.module.rules.push({
    test: /\.mdx$/,
    use: ["babel-loader", "@mdx-js/loader"],
  });
  return config;
};
```

## Full Sample `extension.config.js`

Below are sample configurations for the different sections in `extension.config.js` using webpack.

### Webpack Configuration Sample

```js
const NodePolyfillPlugin = require("node-polyfill-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  config: (config) => {
    config.plugins = [
      ...config.plugins,
      new NodePolyfillPlugin({
        additionalAliases: ["process"],
      }),
    ];
    return config;
  },
};
```

The `extension.config.js` types [are defined here](https://github.com/extension-js/extension.js/blob/main/programs/develop/commands/commands-lib/config-types.ts).

## Best Practices

- **Use the `extension.config.js` file**: Leverage the `extension.config.js` file to
  customize your extension's behavior.
- **Separate browser-specific configurations**: Keep browser-specific configurations
  in the `browser` key.
- **Customize commands**: Use the `commands` key to adjust the behavior of commands
  like `dev`, `preview`, and `build`.
