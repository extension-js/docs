Extension.js allows you to customize browser preferences for Firefox and other Gecko-based browsers.
These preferences can be configured through the `preferences` property in the `extension.config.js` file,
which then adds the custom preferences to the browser's user profile during development.

## How Does It Work?

Browser preferences are settings that can be configured to customize the behavior of the browser. Extension.js will hook into the browser's profile directory and modify the preferences file to set the custom preferences you define in the configuration file.

## How to Set Custom Preferences

To set custom preferences, add a `preferences` key to the browser configuration in your `extension.config.js`.
These preferences will be passed to the browser during the development process, modifying its behavior according to your configuration.

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how you can set custom preferences for Firefox and Gecko-based browsers in your `extension.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    firefox: {
      preferences: {
        "browser.startup.homepage": "https://developer.mozilla.org",
        "devtools.theme": "dark",
        "dom.webnotifications.enabled": false,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

In this example:

- `browser.startup.homepage` sets the default homepage for Firefox.
- `devtools.theme` sets the theme of the developer tools to dark mode.
- `dom.webnotifications.enabled` disables web notifications.

## Using Preferences in the Configuration File

Below is the interface for configuring browser preferences within your `extension.config.js`:

```ts
interface DevOptions {
  browser: "firefox" | "gecko-based";
  preferences?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

> Note from the Author: The `preferences` object can contain any key-value pair that is valid for the browser's preferences. While it is theoretically possible to set any preference on Chromium-based browsers, there is no guarantee that all preferences will work as expected.

This allows you to customize preferences like the homepage, DevTools configuration, or disable certain browser features like web notifications.

### Example with Custom Profile

You can also specify a custom profile for Firefox using the `profile` option along with `preferences`:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    firefox: {
      profile: "path/to/custom-profile",
      preferences: {
        "browser.startup.homepage": "https://example.com",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## More Detailed Preferences

For a comprehensive list of available Firefox preferences, you can explore the [Firefox source code](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/) where many default preferences are defined in `all.js` or `firefox.js`.

## Best Practices

- **Use Custom Profiles**: It is a good idea to use separate profiles for different browsers during development to keep testing environments isolated.
- **Set Browser-Specific Preferences**: Customize browser preferences to optimize your development environment, such as disabling web notifications or setting custom homepages.
