# HTML

In an extension, HTML files serve as the foundation for user interfaces such as popups, options pages, and new tab pages. Extension.js ensures that HTML files defined in the `manifest.json` file are correctly processed, with full support for styles, scripts, and static assets.

## HTML File Support

Extension.js offers first-class support for HTML files, ensuring hot-module replacement (HMR) where applicable. It handles asset injection (images, CSS, JS), live-reloading, and updates.

The following manifest fields use HTML files as entry points:

| Manifest Field                       | File Type Expected | HMR Support |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| `action.default_popup`               | .html              | Yes         |
| `background.page`                    | .html              | Yes         |
| `chrome_settings_overrides.homepage` | .html              | Yes         |
| `chrome_url_overrides.newtab`        | .html              | Yes         |
| `chrome_url_overrides.history`       | .html              | Yes         |
| `chrome_url_overrides.bookmarks`     | .html              | Yes         |
| `devtools_page`                      | .html              | Yes         |
| `options_ui.page`                    | .html              | Yes         |
| `page_action.default_popup`          | .html              | Yes         |
| `sandbox.pages`                      | .html              | Yes         |
| `side_panel.default_panel`           | .html              | Yes         |
| `sidebar_action.default_panel`       | .html              | Yes         |

## Sample HTML File

Here’s a basic example of an HTML file used in an extension:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Extension Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="content">
      <h1>Welcome to My Extension</h1>
      <p>This is a sample extension page.</p>
    </div>
    <script src="./js/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Handling HTML Files Not Declared in `manifest.json`

If you need to include additional HTML files that are not declared in the `manifest.json`, such as sandboxed iframes or extra pages, you can place these files in the `/pages` folder. Extension.js will process the HTML files in this folder as it would for any HTML entry point defined in the manifest.

**Example Usage:**
Place your HTML file in the `/pages` folder, and it will be bundled and available for use, with full support for HMR, asset injection, and other processing steps.

```plaintext
pages/
└── extra-page.html
```

This allows you to add extra pages to your extension without cluttering the manifest or needing to specify them directly there.

For more details, refer to the [Special Folders documentation](../features/special-folders.mdx).

## Output Path

The output path for HTML files is always structured as `[feature]/index[ext]`. For example, if you're working on a new tab override, the resulting files would look like this:

```plaintext
chrome_url_overrides/
├── index.html
├── index.css
└── index.js
```

## How Extension.js Handles HTML

The plugin for HTML file support in Extension.js ensures that the following steps occur during compilation:

1. **Emit HTML File:** The original HTML file is included in the compilation process.
2. **Inject Assets:** Static assets like `<img>`, `<link>`, and `<script>` are added to the compilation.
3. **Inject Styles and Scripts:** CSS and JavaScript files referenced in the HTML file are processed and included as part of the output.
4. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** HMR is enabled for the scripts in HTML files, allowing live-reloading during development.
5. **Error Handling:** Common errors related to HTML files are caught, and suggestions are made to resolve them.

## Best Practices

- Always reference assets using relative paths to ensure they are correctly bundled.
- Use special folders like `pages/` for additional HTML pages outside the scope of the manifest.
- Ensure your manifest fields correctly reference HTML files, especially for features like `action.default_popup` and `chrome_url_overrides`.
